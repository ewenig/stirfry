Stirfry parses the Gracie's Weekly Menus site for days when stir fry are available.

Files:
-----
stir-fry.sh :: grabs the menu and dumps it to the stirfry directory for parsing, then calls the perl script.
stir-fry.pl :: parses the menu and scoops out a nice HTML file
stirfry.js  :: javascript for highlighting the correct day & telling you if there is stir fry right now.
lib/Gracies/StirFry/Parser.pm :: parser module for Gracie's menu

Usage: Export $STIRFRY_DIR to your stirfry directory, and run stirfry.sh as a cronjob every Monday at midnight (0 0 * * 1). Change the absolute paths in stir-fry.sh and stir-fry.pl to match your web server directory.
